<h1>The Best Games According to me</h1>
<h2>My top 3 games of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Grand Theft Auto: SanAndreas</h3>
<p>
  It's larger than the biggest RPG, has more story than the heftiest adventure
  game, and has almost as many mini-games as Nintendo's Mario Party.
  Additionally, it has a production value that's second to none, boasts a
  faithfulness to '90s source material with an eerie accuracy, and provides more
  hours of entertainment than all the previous Grand Theft Autos combined.
</p>
<h3>Gran Turismo 4</h3>
<p>
  When Gran Turismo 3: A-Spec came out it was hard to believe that anything
  better could come from the little black box underneath our TV, but GT4 has
  gone and proved that that was just the beginning for this system. The graphics
  have been redone absolutely everywhere. The cars are more detailed, the levels
  have been given a flurry of new details and taking in the whole experience is
  like being cleaning off a dirty pair of glasses to see the world as it truly
  is.
</p>
<h3>Red Dead Redemption</h3>
<p>
  The storyline of Red Dead Redemption will take you all over a vast swath of
  countryside that straddles the border between the U.S. and Mexico. Along the
  way you'll meet, assist, and spill blood with a fantastic cast of supporting
  characters as Marston attempts to set things straight. The characters are
  wonderful with top notch dialogue and voice acting -- all good enough to make
  you feel a part of the world.
